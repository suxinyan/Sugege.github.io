I'm a fifth-year undergraduate student from the Chinese Network Information Center (CNIC), [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/). My research directions include social network analysis, influence maximization, information cascading prediction, and observational study in causal inference.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Li](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~leejun) from CNIC and [Prof. Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=YVXrszoAAAAJ) from Tsinghua University.

You can find my CV here: [Sue's CV](../assets/CV_su.pdf).
